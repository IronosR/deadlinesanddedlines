            <h3 class="question" id="Q1">1. What is Project Focus?</h3>
            <p class="answer">Project Focus is a web-app and mobile app that behaves like a guide to help the user on the
                task at hand
                through timers. By setting a dedicated timer to concentrate on one or more tasks, that interval will be used
                to achieve or make progress on the desired objective. In addition, allow you to set time for you next task
                so that you can dive straight into your work without the hassle of setting up a timer or a schedule</p>

            <p class="answer">The direction of this application is built towards having the freedom to mount your focus
                session the way you want without dealing with much hassle and instead, using the time to tick the

                labour. Whether it be a study session for an exam or a deadline to finish an entire project. Our approach
